Hey!  
This is where I’m keeping my cybersecurity assignments and reports. I’m just starting out, so everything here is the result of my learning and experiments.

## 2. Phishing Email Analysis

**What I Did**

I looked at a sample phishing email and tried to find things that make it suspicious.  
I checked the sender’s email address, the links, and the language used in the email.  
I also used free online tools to analyze the email headers and gather more clues.

**Files**

- **phishing_sample.eml**: The fake email I analyzed.
- **phishing_report.html**: My notes and findings about the email.
- **interview_answers.txt**: (Optional) My answers to some common questions about phishing.

**What I Learned**

- **How to spot fake or spoofed email addresses.**
- **How to recognize urgent or threatening language.**
- **How to check if a link is safe or not.**
- **How to use online tools to analyze email headers.**
- **How to document my findings in a clear report.**
