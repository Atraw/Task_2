## 2. Phishing Email Analysis

### What I Did
I looked at a sample phishing email and tried to find things that make it suspicious.  
I checked the sender’s email address, the links, and the language used in the email.

### Files
- **phishing_sample.eml**: The fake email I analyzed.
- **phishing_report.html**: My notes and findings about the email.

### What I Learned
- How to spot fake or spoofed email addresses.
- How to recognize urgent or threatening language.
- How to check if a link is safe or not.
